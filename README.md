# Recoil Counter Example

This is a simple example of using Recoil, a state management library for React. It demonstrates how to create a counter component using Recoil's atoms and hooks.



## About Recoil

Recoil is a state management library for React developed by Facebook. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage the state of your React applications. Recoil aims to address some of the challenges and complexities associated with state management in larger React applications.

### Key Concepts

Recoil introduces the following key concepts:

- **Atoms**: Atoms are the fundamental units of state in Recoil. They represent individual pieces of state that can be read from and written to by components.

- **Selectors**: Selectors are derived state in Recoil. They allow you to compute and derive new state based on the values of atoms or other selectors.

- **Hooks**: Recoil provides a set of hooks that allow components to interact with atoms and selectors. The `useRecoilState` hook allows components to read and write atom values, while the `useRecoilValue` hook allows components to read atom or selector values.

### Usage

To use Recoil in your own React application, follow these steps:

1. Install Recoil as a dependency:
    npm install recoil

2. Import the necessary Recoil components in your file:
    import React from 'react';
    import { RecoilRoot, atom, useRecoilState } from 'recoil';
